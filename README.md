# sqlalchemy-challenge

This project performs a climate analysis on Honolulu, Hawaii, using Python, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The analysis includes precipitation and station data exploration, where we retrieve the most recent 12 months of precipitation data, identify the most active weather station, and analyze temperature trends. The results are visualized using data plots such as a precipitation trend bar graphs and a histogram of temperature observations. Additionally, a Flask API is developed to serve climate data through various endpoints, providing JSON-formatted responses for precipitation data, station details, and temperature statistics.

The project follows best practices in coding conventions, ensuring efficient and reusable code. The database connection is established using SQLAlchemy, and queries are designed to extract meaningful insights from the dataset. The Flask API includes static and dynamic routes that allow users to access climate data for specific date ranges.
